Q&A

--- Slide 3 ---
Data Spectrum: Structured / Semi-Structured / Unstructured (Analogy: Library)
Structured: reference section (tables, CSV, Parquet, Avro).
Semi-Structured: magazine section (JSON, XML) — flexible nested fields.
Unstructured: art/photo books (images, videos, PDFs) — binary data; metadata required for search.

--- Slide 4 ---
Evolution of Data Platforms (Analogy: Housing & Storage)
Database (OLTP): Delivery truck — ACID, fast transactions.
Data Warehouse (OLAP): Specialized library — schema-on-write, BI.
Data Lake: Raw land plot — stores all formats, cheap but needs governance.
Data Lakehouse: Modern city — combines lake flexibility with warehouse governance.

--- Slide 5 ---
The Genesis: Hadoop → Spark → Databricks
Hadoop: storage + MapReduce — solved scale but heavy for iterative workloads.
Spark: in-memory distributed engine for SQL, streaming, ML.
Databricks: SaaS platform by Spark creators — integrated UX, Delta Lake, MLflow, Unity Catalog.

--- Slide 6 ---
Deployments & Providers
AWS, Azure, GCP (cloud SaaS).
Databricks on Kubernetes (Private Preview) for private cloud options.
Databricks does not 'store' data — uses your object storage (S3/ADLS/GCS).

--- Slide 7 ---
Compute & Serverless
Cluster types: All-purpose vs Job clusters.
Serverless: infra-managed; pros: quick start, autoscaling; cons: less control.
Choose based on workload SLA and cost model.

--- Slide 8 ---
Workspace, Notebooks & Jobs (PySpark sample)
df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header","true").load("/path/to/sample.csv")
display(df)  # Databricks notebook helper

--- Slide 9 ---
ACID on Delta Lake — Key Concepts
Transaction log (_delta_log): ordered JSON commits + periodic Parquet checkpoints.
Atomic commits, snapshot isolation, schema enforcement/evolution.
Time travel & Change Data Feed (CDF).

--- Slide 10 ---
Delta Log: Inspect commits and checkpoints (PySpark)
# Inspect commit JSONs
commits = spark.read.json("/mnt/lake/mytable/_delta_log/*.json")
commits.select("commitInfo.*").show(truncate=False)

# Use DeltaTable API for history
from delta.tables import DeltaTable
dt = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/mnt/lake/mytable")
dt.history(20).show(truncate=False)

--- Slide 11 ---
Delta vs Iceberg (Guidance)
Delta: Databricks-optimized features (MERGE, CDF, OPTIMIZE, Z-Order).
Iceberg: Engine-agnostic; prefer for heterogeneous multi-engine setups.

--- Slide 12 ---
Medallion Architecture (Bronze→Silver→Gold)
Bronze: raw ingest as-is (landing zone).
Silver: cleansed and enriched (dedupe, sessionization).
Gold: aggregates & feature tables for BI/ML.

--- Slide 13 ---
Bronze→Silver→Gold SQL Example
-- Bronze
CREATE TABLE bronze.clickstream USING DELTA LOCATION '/mnt/lake/bronze/clickstream';

-- Silver (example)
CREATE TABLE silver.sessions USING DELTA AS
SELECT userId, sessionId, min(eventTime) as session_start
FROM bronze.clickstream WHERE userId IS NOT NULL GROUP BY userId, sessionId;

-- Gold (DAU)
CREATE TABLE gold.dau USING DELTA AS
SELECT date(session_start) as dt, COUNT(DISTINCT userId) as dau FROM silver.sessions GROUP BY date(session_start);

--- Slide 14 ---
Unstructured Data: How to manage images & videos
Store binaries in object storage; maintain metadata (path, checksum, labels) in Delta.
Use embeddings + vector search for semantic retrieval; file-level ops for binaries.

--- Slide 15 ---
Example: Create metadata table from images (PySpark)
imgs = spark.read.format("binaryFile").load("/mnt/landing/images/")
from pyspark.sql.functions import sha2, col
meta = imgs.select(col("path"), sha2(col("content"),256).alias("sha256"))
meta.write.format("delta").saveAsTable("demo.assets.images_meta")

--- Slide 16 ---
CRUD Internals: INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE / MERGE / TRUNCATE / DROP
INSERT: append new Parquet files; commit entry references them.
UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE: copy-on-write → new files for affected data; old files are marked removed.
TRUNCATE: metadata updated to zero files; DROP: metadata removed; VACUUM physically deletes unreferenced files.

--- Slide 17 ---
Parquet File Creation & Minimization
Parquet files are created by Spark write tasks; a transaction may produce many files.
Minimize files: coalesce/repartition writes, use auto-optimization, OPTIMIZE/Z-ORDER for compaction.
Aim file sizes ~128-512MB depending on workload.

--- Slide 18 ---
Compaction & OPTIMIZE (examples)
-- Databricks SQL (OPTIMIZE)
OPTIMIZE demo.retail.customers ZORDER BY (customer_id);

-- PySpark manual rewrite
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/lake/demo/retail/customers")
df.repartition(50).write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/mnt/lake/demo/retail/customers")

--- Slide 19 ---
Indexing Concepts & Data Skipping
Delta uses file-level statistics (min/max) for data skipping.
Z-Ordering clusters data to improve pruning; external index engines (Hyperspace) exist for specialized cases.

--- Slide 20 ---
Performance Optimization Checklist
Partition on low-cardinality filter columns; avoid high-cardinality partitions.
Tune shuffle partitions and coalesce output files.
Enable AQE and caching for hot datasets.
Use Photon/SQL Warehouses for BI workloads.

--- Slide 21 ---
Time Travel & Restore (examples)
-- SQL time travel
SELECT * FROM demo.retail.customers VERSION AS OF 5;

-- PySpark read by version and backup then restore
spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 5).load("/mnt/lake/demo/retail/customers")   .write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("demo.retail.customers_restore_v5")

--- Slide 22 ---
VACUUM & Retention Best Practices
VACUUM removes files older than retention. Keep retention >= recovery need.
Do not run VACUUM lightly; coordinate with SRE/backup owners.

--- Slide 23 ---
Audit Trail & History (PySpark)
from delta.tables import DeltaTable
dt = DeltaTable.forName(spark, "demo.retail.customers")
hist = dt.history(100)
hist.select("version","timestamp","userId","operation","operationMetrics").show(truncate=False)

# Build audit table from commitInfo
commits = spark.read.json("/mnt/lake/demo/retail/customers/_delta_log/*.json")
commits.select("commitInfo.*").write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("audit.delta_commits")

--- Slide 24 ---
Logs in S3 & Security
_delta_log is stored beside data — secure using IAM, encryption, least-privilege.
Apply lifecycle policies and ensure backups for compliance.

--- Slide 25 ---
Advanced Topics: CDF, Vector Search, MLflow
CDF for incremental change extraction; use for CDC or incremental ETL.
Vector search for embeddings-based semantic queries over unstructured assets.
MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry integrated in Databricks.

--- Slide 26 ---
Conclusion & Next Steps
Databricks + Delta unlocks ACID, scale, and unified data+AI platform.
Plan retention, compaction, partitioning, and governance to get best results.
Live demo: ingestion → Delta write → MERGE → OPTIMIZE → time travel → audit.
